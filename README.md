# Softid Note

## Operational Identification of Software Components in the Virtual Observatory

This repository holds a (draft) IVOA Note, developed within the IVOA Operations
Interest Group and discussing best practice for client (especially operational client)
and server software to identify itself to other software with which it is interacting.

A formatted version of the text may be available at
http://docs.g-vo.org/softid.pdf,
though this is not guaranteed to be in place or up to date.

Once complete, this Note may eventually be hosted in the
[IVOA Document Repository](https://www.ivoa.net/documents/#notes).
